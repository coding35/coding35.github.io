    Storing hierarchial data is a common application requirement and there are
    several ways to accomplish the task in SQL. Hierarchial data is generally
    structured as a tree, where each node has a parent and zero or more
    children. The top level node is called the root node and has no parent. The
    bottom level nodes are called leaf nodes and have no children.

  <h4>Storing Hierarchial Data</h4>
  <p>There are several ways to store hierarchial data in SQL.</p>
  <h5>Adjacency List</h5>
  <p>
    The most commonly used is the Adjacency List. Depending on the use case,
    this type of structure can be considered somewhat of an anti-pattern in SQL
    since its shortcomings outweigh its benefits. The Adjacency List structure
    uses a table that stores the parent-child relationships whereby each row
    contains a reference to the parent id. This structure may justifiably
    perform well for small or shallow hierarchial data sets, but as the data set
    grows, querying the data will require many joins which may degrade
    performance. The alternative is to return all the data and build the tree in
    the application which is not optimal or to use a recursive query, but this
    is not supported in all SQL dialects.
  </p>
  <h5>Path Enumeration</h5>
  <p>
    The Path Enumeration structure uses a table that stores the parent-child
    relationships whereby each row contains a reference to the parent id and a
    path enumeration. The path enumeration is a string that contains the
    parent-child relationships in the form of a path. ie. "1/2/5/7". Some of the
    benefits of this structure consist of ease of insert, update, and sort.
    Referential integrity is not enforced in this structure, but can be managed
    by the application.
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
      WHERE '1/3/6/7/' LIKE path || '%'; -- returns all ancestors
    </pre
  >
  <pre class="prettyprint">
      WHERE path LIKE '1/4' || '%'; -- returns all descendants
    </pre
  >
  <h5>Nested Sets</h5>
  <p>
    A Nested Set structure uses a table that stores the parent-child
    relationships by storing information with each node that pertains to the set
    of its descendants rather than the nodes immediate parent. This particular
    structure performs best when its more important to query the data instead of
    insert, update, delete or sort.
  </p>
  <h5>Closure Table</h5>
  <p>
    The closure table structure stores all paths throughout the tree and not
    just the direct parent-child relationship. A separate table is used that
    consists of two columns each with a foreign key to the parent table. The
    first column is the parent id and the second column is the child id. The
    closure table is used to store all the paths throughout the tree. This
    structure is best suited for applications that require frequent queries of
    the data.
