    Low-level components can can participate in high-level components, but can
    never call a high-level component directly. This is where the phrase "don't
    call us, we'll call you" comes from. The high-level component will call the
    low-level component when and if it is needed.

    The Hollywood Principle is a technique for building frameworks or components
    so that lower-level components can be hooked into the computation of the algorithm as needed.
    The benefit of this principle is that it allows you to design a system that allows
    low-level components to be used while preventing other classes from depending on them.
