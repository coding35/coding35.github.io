    <p>A deliberate conscious and thoughtful way to approach reading.</p>

    <p>Processing written material is not a natural mental ability. Our brains are much more suited to observation and
        mimicking. As such, it
        is important to develop a deliberate, thoughtful, and active approach to reading. There are many ways to improve
        reading comprehension and the following is a hybrid
        of several methods.
    </p>
    <p>This proposed methodology includes leveraging the SQ3R method, the Cornell Note Taking System, and the spacing
        effect.</p>

    <h4>SQ3R</h4>
    <p>First introduced by Francis P. Roberson in his 1946 book Effective Study, this method presents a more
        efficient approach to reading. As an experimental psychologist
        Roberson was interested in how to improve the reading comprehension of his students and through his work at OSU
        in the How-To-Study program he developed the SQ3R method.
        The following steps summarize the method.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Survey</span>: Scan the table of contents and chapter summaries for an overview. </li>
        <li><span>Question</span>: Note any questions you have. </li>
        <li><span>Read</span>: Read in its entirety. </li>
        <li><span>Recite</span>: Summarize, take notes, and put in your own words. </li>
        <li><span>Review</span>: Reread, expand notes, and discuss with colleagues. </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Cornell Note Taking System</h4>
    <p>The Cornell Note Taking System is a method of note taking that was developed by Walter Pauk in the 1950s. The
        system is based on the idea that the brain is better at
        remembering information when it is presented in a visual and kinesthetic manner.

    <h4>Spacing Effect</h4>
    <p>Spacing describes the activity of testing the material repeatably by recalling the same material over and over.
        This deliberate testing works by strengthening mental connections.</p>
    <p>Piotr Wozniak developed an algorithm that exercises the spacing effect using a flashcard technique that tracks
        performance. This algorithm retests based on the observed memory-decay curve. </p>
