    <p>A compound pattern is simply a design pattern that incorporates two or more other patterns to solve a problem.
        An example of a compound pattern is the Model-View-Controller pattern, which incorporates the Observer,
        Strategy, and Composite patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
        In MVC, the model makes use of the observer pattern to notify the view of any changes to the model. The
        controller
        is the strategy for the view to allow for a view to use different implementations of the controller to change
        the
        behavior of the view. The view is a composite of other views. (ie. partials etc). In conjunction, these patterns
        keep the design clear and flexible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Should a controller needing to be reused by a different model, the adapter pattern can be used to adapt the new
        model to the existing controller.
    </p>

        <p>
            Adapted to the web, the MVC pattern functions where by the model may not have the ability to directly
            communicate with the view. Instead, the controller acts as the intermediary between the model and the view.
