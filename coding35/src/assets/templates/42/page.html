    The Strategy pattern or Policy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that
    allows you to define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a
    separate class for encapsulation, and make their objects independent and
    interchangeable by the client.

    A constant in software is change. The challenge is to design a system that
    can adapt to change and still be maintainable. By separating out the things
    that change from the things that stay the same, we can create a system that
    is able to handle one of many behaviors and even change behaviors at
    runtime.

  <h4>Considerations when using the Strategy pattern:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Inheritance for code reuse.</li>
    <li>Delegates behavior to composed objects.</li>
    <li>Behavior change at runtime.</li>
    <li>Increased number of objects.</li>
  </ul>
