            <h4>Understanding the Context and Domain</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bounded context with intrinsic language.</li>
                <li>Avoid the ball of mud. I think this means stay within a context.</li>
                <li>Don't allow technology to be the sole solution to a business process.</li>
                <li>Can use adapter pattern to interface with the domain context without polluting the domain model.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Strategic Design with Subdomains</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A core domain is where your organization makes its strategic investment in software. It is the
                    highest priority projects.</li>
                <li>Subdomains are a way to break down a large domain into smaller, more manageable pieces.</li>
                <li>Subdomains can be further broken down into bounded contexts.</li>
                <li>Subdomains can be categorized as core, supporting, or generic.</li>
                <li>Legacy systems can be broken down into logical models or area of expertise, can be considered
                    subdomain and in turn a bounded context.</li>
                <li>A supporting subdomain is necessary to support a core domain. It may not need the kind of investment
                    given to the core but instead rely on external services or systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Section 4: Stategic Design with Context Mapping</h4>
            <ul>
                <ul><strong>Shared Kernel</strong>
                    <li>Rare that two teams will share a core model</li>
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Customer-Supplier</strong>
                    <li>Upstream team will have an impact on the downstream team.</li>
                    <li>Upstream team needs to satisfy the downstream team.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Conformist</strong>
                    <li>Upstream and downstream team relationship. The downstream team will just conform to the upstream
                        team.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Anti-Corruption Layer</strong>
                    <li>Two teams with separate models but the downstream team does not want to be influenced by the
                        upstream team model. Its a translation layer that transforms the upstream model to something
                        that
                        works for the downstream team.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Open Host Service</strong>
                    < <li>A well documented and defined model created by the upstream team that is easy to translate and
                        consume by the downstream team.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Published Language</strong>
                    <li>A well documented data format created by the upstream team that allows the downstream team to
                        very
                        comfortably consume data from the upstream team. Common for open host service to provide this.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Separate Ways</strong>
                    <li>Integration that could take place between teams but for some reason, team two goes a separate
                        way.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Big Ball of Mud</strong>
                    <li>When you make changes in one part of the model, it will very likely have an impact in another
                        part
                        of the model in another area. Rippling problems. Avoid it. If you have to integrate, try to use
                        an
                        anti-corruption layer.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul><strong>Making good use of Context Mapping</strong>
                    <li>A client bounded context communicating with a service bounded context.</li>
                    <li>RPC calls can fail to complete integration but when it works its quite capable. OHS/PL on
                        service
                        and ACL on client</li>
                    <li>RESTful HTTP. OHS/PL on service and ACL on client. Design the resources to work with the
                        clients,
                        The service shouldn’t force consumers into a conformist relationship.</li>
                    <li>Messaging. Pub/Sub with some messaging mechanism. Must support at least one delivery. The
                        subscribing context must be idempotent meaning it must have the ability to de-duplicate a
                        redelivered message.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>Section 5: Tactical Design with Aggregates</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Right size modeling of Aggregates</li>
                <li>Abstract Carefully</li>
                <li>Breakup Aggregates and compose aggregates within.</li>
                <li>Depending on if updates are needed immediately across aggregates compose them together. If not,
                    aggregates can be separated for eventual consistency.</li>
                <li>Testable Units</li>
                <li>Design aggregates to accommodate unit tests.</li>
                <li>Small aggregates will help make aggregates testable.</li>
                <li>Testing for the correctness and robustness of each of the aggregate components.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Section 6: Tactical Design with Domain Events</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A publishing bounded context interfaces with a messaging system which then notifies any domain
                    bounded contexts subscriber.</li>
                <li>Ensure messages to subscribers adheres to causal consistency. Think of instant messaging system
                    where messages are kept in order.</li>
                <li>Designing, Implementing, and Using Domain Events</li>
                <li>Create interface for all domain events with timestamp getter.</li>
                <li>Example might be something like:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Product added to cart. ProductAddedToCart</li>
                    <li>Event is created. ProductCommittedToCart with same properties as ProductAddedToCart.</li>
                    <li>The ProductCommittedToCart Event reads data from the ProductAddedToCart and notifies other
                        domain subscribers.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Event Sourcing</li>
                <li>An interesting concept. Based on a stream of messages into the message store, the aggregate class
                    can be reconstituted with all the event data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Section 7: Acceleration and Management Tools</h4>
            <ul>
                <ul><strong>Event Storming</strong>
                    < <li>A process of discovering the implementation detail.</li>
                        <li>Focus on a business process. Everybody on the team learns about the models needed.</li>
                        <li>Asking the right questions of the right people. Domain experts must be present.</li>
                        <li>Events are something that happened. ProductCreated, OrderSubmitted, etc. Asking for an event
                            is the
                            first step in creating domain events. A left to right time series will be created.</li>
                        <li>Step 1. Create event time series from left to right.</li>
                        <li>Step 2. Discover the commands that will cause the domain event(s). A time series lane will
                            have
                            command and event, command and event, etc…</li>
                        <li>Step 3. Define the Aggregates/objects of the model. Aggregates handles the commands and emit
                            domain
                            events. The aggregate is the binding.</li>
                        <li>Step 4. Identify Context Boundaries. Identify the core domain, what is important to the
                            business and
                            what is generic.</li>
                        <li>Step 5. Understand certain views that are important to the user.</li>
                        <li>SWOT Analysis</li>
                        <li>Can be handy to visualize where the teams focus needs to happen. Can be helpful to identify
                            gaps in
                            knowledge.</li>
                        <li>Modeling Spikes in and Modeling Debt</li>
                        <li>Velocity changes from inception to refinement. Late learning will cause the model to be
                            adjusted.
                            Revisiting the model is debt.</li>
                        <li>Identifying Tasks and Estimates</li>
                        <li>While Event Storming, estimates on the Command, Events, and Aggregates can be created.</li>
