    The Principle of Least Knowledge (PLK) or Law of Demeter (LOD) is a design
    guideline useful for developing object-oriented programs. The principle
    states that for any object, it is important to control the number of classes
    that it interacts with. This guideline ensures that our classes are loosely
    coupled thereby making code easier to maintain and extend.
  </p>
  <p>
    The overall goal of the PLK is to reduce the dependencies between classes
    and promote encapsulation. An object should only interact with its immediate
    neighbors and not with objects further away. An object should only
    communicate with objects through its own interface.

    <h4>An object should only call methods of:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Itself</li>
      <li>Objects passed in as a parameter to the method</li>
      <li>Any object it creates</li>
      <li>Any components of the object</li>
      <li>Method parameters</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
    Following PLK should ensure a level of orthogonality in our code whereby a
    component is independent of its peers. The more orthogonal a component is,
    the less it knows about its peers and changes in one part of the code will
    not affect other parts.

  <h4>Example</h4>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
    class ClassA:
        def doSomething(self, b):
        b.doSomething()

    class ClassB:
        def doSomething(self):
            c = ClassC()
            c.doSomething()

    class ClassC:
        def doSomething(self):
            # Perform some action
