    The sidecar pattern is a common pattern used in distributed and
    microservices architectures. It is often used in conjunction with there
    patterns and technologies such as container orchestration, service meshes,
    and API gateways.
  </p>
  <p>
    The pattern involves separating the functionality of an application into
    components that are co-located alongside the main application. These
    components are often referred to as sidecars and they are used to provide
    additional functionality to the main application such as monitoring,
    logging, routing, security, and resiliency patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sidecar components are specialized containers that communicate to the main
    application over an internal host network interface using lightweight
    communication protocols such as HTTP, gRPC, or WebSockets.

  <h4>Microsoft documentation states</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "This pattern is named Sidecar because it resembles a sidecar attached to
      a motorcycle. In the pattern, the sidecar is attached to a parent
      application and provides supporting features for the application. The
      sidecar also shares the same lifecycle as the parent application, being
      created and retired alongside the parent. The sidecar pattern is sometimes
      referred to as the sidekick pattern and is a decomposition pattern."

    <h4>Benefits of the Sidecar pattern.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add new functionality to existing applications without having to modify
        core application code.
      </li>
      <li>The sidecar can be independently developed, tested and deployed.</li>
      <li>
        Sidecars can be used to extend the lifetime of legacy applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Providing additional functionality such as monitoring, logging, routing,
        security, and resiliency patterns.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Added latency</li>
      <li>
        Is the sidecar cross-cutting? If so a shared microservice might be a
        better approach.
      </li>
      <li>Management and scaling.</li>
    </ul>
