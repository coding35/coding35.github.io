    The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified
    interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex <i>set</i> of classes. Simply,
    it is a wrapper that encapsulates the complexity of a system and provides a simple
    easy to use interface. The Facade Pattern is similar to the Adapter Pattern in that
    it provides a simplified interface to a complex system. However, the Facade Pattern
    is used to simplify a system while the Adapter Pattern is used to convert the
    interface of a class into another interface that the client expects.

  <p>
    Another benefit is that the Facade Pattern decouples the client implementation 
    from the subsystem. A client coded to a facade rather than directly coupled to the subsystem
    will require changes only be made to the facade rather than the client code.
