    Cloud computing categories are defined primarily by how much
    responsibility you have for the computing resources you use.
    The benefit of cloud computing is that you can get your
    applications up and running faster, with improved manageability
    and less maintenance, and that you can adjust your resources
    quickly to meet your business needs.
