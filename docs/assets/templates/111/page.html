        Vectorization is the process of converting text data into numerical data that can be used by machine learning
        algorithms.
        This process is essential for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment analysis, text
        classification, and named entity recognition.

            This example shows a vectorization table for country and capital names. The table represents the countries
            and
            capitals as binary vectors, where 1 indicates the presence of a word in the text data, and 0 indicates the
            absence of a word.
        </p>

        Given Italy - Rome = X - Athens (X = Greece), we can calculate the vector representation of X by subtracting the
        vector representation of Rome from the vector representation of Italy and adding the vector representation of
        Athens. </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
        Italy - Rome = [1, 0, 0, 1] - [0, 1, 0, 1] = [1, -1, 0, 0]

        X = Italy - Rome + Athens = [1, -1, 0, 0] + [0, 1, 1, 0] = [1, 0, 1, 0] = Greece

        Therefore, the vector representation of Greece is [1, 0, 1, 0].
