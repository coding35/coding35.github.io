    A full adder is a combinational logic circuit that adds two bits and a carry
    bit. This type of adder requires the carry bits to propagate, or ripple,
    through the circuit. Therefore, this circuit is referred to as a ripple
    carry adder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each carry bit that ripples to the next full adder introduces a small delay,
    so extending the design to handle more bits makes the circuit slower and the
    output will be inaccurate until all the carry bits have the time to
    propagate.
  </p>

    The ripple carry adder is the basis for more complex adder circuits, such as
    the carry look-ahead adder.
