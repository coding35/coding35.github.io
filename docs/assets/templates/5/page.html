    <p>The Anti-Corruption layer Pattern first proposed by Eric Evans in Domain-Driven Design promotes the idea that
        an application's design not be limited by dependencies outside its domain. For example, a domain model should
        not be
        limited by the data structures of a legacy database or the APIs of a legacy system.
    </p>

    <p>In short this pattern is used to isolate an application domain from external dependencies by
        providing a translation layer between itself and dependant subsystems.
        This layer ensures that the calling application is not beholden to data structures, obsolete technologies and
        APIs outside of its control. This pattern can be particularly useful in legacy migrations or when two systems
        with different data models or semantics need to communicate.

    <p>
        By isolating the domain model from external dependencies, applications can be more easily maintained to
        modern standards and technologies without impacting the rest of the system. In the above example, the
        communication between systems is handled by the Anti-Corruption Layer. This layer is responsible for translating
        data models and APIs between the separate systems.

    <h4>
        Considerations
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Added latency</li>
        <li>Management and scaling</li>
        <li>Possible Partitioning</li>
    </ul>


    <p>
        This pattern could be co-located with a parent application as a sidecar component or it could be
        implemented as a separate microservice as show in the digram above.
