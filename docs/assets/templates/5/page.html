    <p>The Anti-Corruption layer Pattern first proposed by Eric Evans in Domain-Driven Design promotes the idea that
        an application's design not be limited by dependencies outside its domain. For example, a domain model should
        not be
        limited by the data structures of a legacy database or the APIs of a legacy system.
    </p>

    <p>In short this pattern is used to isolate the domain model from external dependencies by
        providing a translation layer between itself and dependant subsystems.
        This layer ensures that the calling application is not beholden data structures, obsolete technologies and
        APIs outside of its control.</p>

        By isolating the domain model from external dependencies, applications can be more easily maintained to
        modern standards and technologies without impacting the rest of the system.
