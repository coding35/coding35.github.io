    The following ARM assembly program calculates the factorial of a number.
  </p>
  <p>n! = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x ... x 2 x 1</p>

  <p>
    For example, 5! (read as "5 factorial") is equal to 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.
  </p>
  <p>The following assembly calculates the factorial of 5.</p>

  <h4>Compile Example</h4>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
        ; Compile the assembly program
        $ as -o factorial.o factorial.s
        ; Link the object file
        $ dl -o factorial factorial.o
        ; Run the program
        $ ./factorial
    </pre>
  <h4>Debug Example</h4>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
    ; Run the program in debug mode
    $ gdb factorial
    ; Set a breakpoint at memory address 0x100000 (the address of the first instruction)
    (gdb) break *0x100000
    ; Run the program
    (gdb) run
    ; Step through the program and continue until the end
    (gdb) continue etc.
    ; Dump of the assembler code
    (gdb) disas
    ; Dump of the registers
    (gdb) info registers
