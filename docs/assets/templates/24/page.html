    A mixin is a type of class designed with the intention for it to be combined
    with other classes through inheritance. Generally not instantiated
    independently, the mixin class provides an optional interface or defined
    functionality for other classes through the inheritance hierarchy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The overreaching goal is to promote reusability and modularity by splitting
    functionality into multiple classes. This allows for more a flexible design
    since it allows a developer to choose which functionality to use. A good
    example may be a class that provides a method for logging messages. By
    placing that functionality into a mixin class, all classes inheriting can
    program to a shared interface or override defined functionality it with
    their own implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to remember the concept of programming to an interface
    instead of an implementation when considering the use of mixins. While it is
    possible to inherit functionality it is not recommended since it incurs
    tight coupling between components. The mixin class is not intended to be
    instantiated directly and is generally better suited for use as an abstract
    class to promote loose coupling as a best practice.
