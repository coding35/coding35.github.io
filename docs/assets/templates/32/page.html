    Lazy loading images on a web page has been around for some time. It is a
    technique that allows you to defer loading of images until they are needed.
    When the user scrolls images are loaded on demand as required. This can
    provide a performance gain by reducing the amount of data that needs to be
    downloaded and rendered by the browser.

    There are a number of ways to implement lazy loading. The most common is to
    use JavaScript to detect when an image is in the viewport and then load the
    image when it is. This is a good solution, but it does require JavaScript.
    This technique implements a listener either on the scroll and/or resize
    event. Another JavaScript solution would be to use the Inspection Observer
    API. This API allows you to detect when an element is in the viewport as it
    uses a placeholder image until the image is needed in the viewport.

    Chrome and Firefox have implemented lazy loading natively. This is done by
    adding the <code>loading="lazy"</code> attribute to the
    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. This attribute tells the browser to defer
    loading of the image.

    Alternatively, you can use a library to polyfill the native lazy loading
    feature and get similar results.

    Due to the fact that lazy loading is a performance enhancement, it can be
    overdone. One example of this is that it may negatively impact the
    performance of your site if you lazy load all images on the page. The best
    practice is to never lazy load images that are within the viewport on page
    load.
