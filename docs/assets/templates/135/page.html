    Created by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958, the perceptron is a decision making model that could take input signals, process them and "then" decide wheather to turn on or off. 
To do this, it calculates the weighted sum of its inputs in order to make a decision. The weights are adjusted through a process called training. This training allows the perceptron to compare its output with a desired output and based on the comparison, the perceptron adjusts its weights accordingly in order to minimize the error between the predicted and desired outputs.

    Today, the premise behind the perceptron in a highly optimized decision making switches. These switches are used to perform calculations very quickly and power machine learning applications. They help computers learn from data, recognize patterns and make decisions.
