    The specification pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to
    define a set of criteria and apply them to an object to determine if it
    meets the criteria. The specification pattern is a useful alternative to
    creating large, complex queries because it allows you to build up a query in
    small, digestible pieces.

    Here are some reasons why the Specification Pattern is beneficial in the
    context of rule engines:
  </p>
  <p>
    Rule engines are systems that evaluate a set of rules or conditions to make
    decisions or take actions. The Specification Pattern is well-suited for
    expressing and managing these rules in a modular and maintainable way.

    Here are some reasons why the Specification Pattern is beneficial in the
    context of rule engines:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Modularity</strong>: Specifications allow you to encapsulate
      individual rules or conditions in separate classes. This modularity makes
      it easier to manage and maintain the rules, as each specification class is
      responsible for a specific condition.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Reusability</strong>: Specifications can be reused across
      different rules or combined in various ways to create more complex
      conditions. This promotes code reuse and reduces duplication of logic.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Readability</strong>: The pattern enhances the readability of the
      rules by providing a clear and structured way to express conditions. Each
      specification class focuses on a specific aspect of the rule, making the
      overall logic easier to understand.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Flexibility</strong>: With composite specifications (like
      AndSpecification, OrSpecification), you can easily combine and modify
      rules to create more sophisticated conditions. This flexibility is crucial
      in rule engines where conditions may need to evolve or be adjusted
      frequently.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Testing</strong>: Specifications can be individually tested,
      providing a high level of confidence that each rule is functioning as
      expected. This makes it easier to verify and maintain the correctness of
      individual conditions.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Encapsulation</strong>: The Specification Pattern helps
      encapsulate the complexity of rule evaluation within dedicated classes.
      This abstraction makes it easier to modify or extend the rule engine
      without affecting the rest of the system.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Overall, the Specification Pattern is a powerful tool for building rule
    engines, offering a clean and organized way to express, manage, and evaluate
    complex conditions or rules
