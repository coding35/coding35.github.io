                Resource Load Time (40%)
                Element Render Delay (<10%)        browser received the resource and the browser rendered the resource
              * how to reduce TTFB so HTML can be delivered as quickly as possible
                * fetch priority in Chrome  link fetchpriority="high" rel="preload" href="img/" as="image" ... in the head or on the element itself
                * make sure the image is discoverable as soon as possible.
                * preload scanning is a microsoft innovation that scans the page for preload links and starts downloading them as soon as possible

                * HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
                * Predictive prefetching (Guess.js)
                * Use pre-rendered (generate static HTML at build time) vs Server-side rendering (SSR)
