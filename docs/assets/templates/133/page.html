    <h3>Processor Microarchitectures</h3>
    <p>
        The following processors are based on the MIPS architecture. MIPS stands for Microprocessor without Interlocked
        Pipeline Stages.
        MIPS is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture that makes the common case fast by including
        only simple, commonly used instructions. The number of instructions is kept small so that the hardware required
        to decode the instruction and its operands can be simple, small, and fast. More elaborate operations that are
        less common are performed using sequences of multiple simple instructions.
    </p>

    <h4>Single-Cycle Processor</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Requires a clock cycle to complete an instruction.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each clock cycle must be long enough to complete the longest instruction.
        </li>
        <li>
            Requires multiple adders wich can increase cost.
        </li>
        <li>
            Has separate memories. One for instructions and one for data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Considered the simplest design.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Multi-Cycle Processor</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Instructions are broken down into multiple simple steps.
        </li>
        <li>
            With multiple steps, the system can complete an instruction in multiple clock cycles. It can be
            considered a state machine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Requires fewer adders than a single-cycle processor but requires additional nonarchitectural registers
            and multiplexers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Has combined memory for instructions and data.
        </li>
        <li>
            The state between cycles can lead to more complex control logic.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Pipelined Processor</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Improves throughput by subdividing the instruction execution into into five stages: instruction fetch,
            instruction decode, execute, memory access, and write back.
        </li>
        <li>
            With five steps, five instructions can be processed at the same time. and because each stage is only a
            fifth of the time,
            the clock cycle can be faster thereby increasing throughput.
        </li>
        <li>
            The challenge with pipelining is dealing with hazards. Hazards are situations that prevent the next
            instruction from
            executing during its designated clock cycle.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Superscalar Processor</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Capable of executing multiple instructions simultaneously.
        </li>

    </ul>
