    The factory in OOP is a design pattern that allows for the creation of
    objects without the need to specify the exact class of the object to create.
    A factory can take one of two primary forms, an factory method or an
    abstract factory.
  </p>
  <p>
    The factory method is a factory that creates objects using methods to keep
    clients decoupled from concrete types. By using inheritance the factory
    method allows a class to defer instantiation to subclasses. This factory
    will create a single object and can be useful when the type of objects it
    must create is not yet known.
  </p>
  <p>
    The abstract factory is a factory that creates a family of component types
    of objects and it does this by leveraging object composition. This factory
    is useful when you have families of products that you want to make sure
    belong together.

    <strong>Remember:</strong>
    <i>
      Using the new operator is instantiating a concrete class resulting in
      tight coupling. This practice is coding to an implementation and not to an
      interface. The factory pattern is the alternative to using the new.
