    A composite is a tree structure of simple and composite objects. The
    composite pattern allows the creation of tree structures where individual
    objects and compositions of objects are treated uniformly. The tree
    structure allows for the application of the same operations over both
    individual objects and compositions of objects.

    A good use case for the composite pattern would be the rendering of a UI
    frame. Each item needs to render itself and its children. The composite
    pattern allows for the same operation to be applied to both the individual
    items and the composite items.
