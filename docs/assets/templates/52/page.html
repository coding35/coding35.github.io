    The command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that is useful when it is necessary
    to separate the request from the execution logic of the request. It is often used
    to log and audit changes in a system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The command pattern encapsulates a request as an object to decouple the sender of the
    request from the object that executes the request.

  <ol>  
    <li>Client - Creates a command object and sets its receiver</li>
    <li>Command - Encapsulates a request as an object</li>
    <li>Invoker - Asks the command to carry out the request</li>
    <li>Receiver - Knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out the request</li>
  </ol>
