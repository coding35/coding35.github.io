        Chaos engineering is a dicipline in software engineering to identify and improve system resliliency. This is
        accomplished by intentionally introducing failures
        into the system to test resiliency.
    </p>
    <p>
        By intentionally introducing controlled failues and disruptions in a system, weaknesses can be proactively
        identified and addressed before they impact users or cause downtime. 
        Along with the benefits of identifying weaknesses, chaos engineering, when done correctly, can also help
        build confidence and a cultural mindset towards resiliency.

        There are many ways to introduce failures into a system. Some of the common ways are:
    <ul>
        <li>Fault Injection</li>
        <li>Traffic Manipulation</li>
        <li>Infrastructure Disruption</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        <h4>Example: Fault Injection</h4>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
            Random _random = new Random();
            async Task ChaosMonkey()
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"\n\nChaosMonkey Invoked: {DateTime.Now}");
                int result = _random.Next(5);
                switch (result)
                {
                    case 0:
                        Console.WriteLine($"Throw exception immediately");
                        throw new Exception("Failure");
                    case 1:
                        Console.WriteLine($"Wait, then throw exception");
                        await Task.Delay(3000);
                        throw new Exception("Failure");
                    case 2:
                        Console.WriteLine($"Wait, then work");
                        await Task.Delay(3000);
                        break;
                }
                Console.WriteLine("Call succeeded");
            }
    </pre>

        The following are some of the tools that can be used to perform chaos engineering:
    <ul>
        <li>Chaos Monkey</li>
        <li>Chaos Toolkit</li>
        <li>Chaos Mesh</li>
        <li>Chaoskube</li>
        <li>Chaosblade</li>
        <li>Chaoskube</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Considerations should when introducing this technique into a system to ensure that the
        system remains stable and does not impact users.
