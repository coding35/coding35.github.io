    A common concept in DBMS and microservice architecture is the ACID
    transaction. This acronym stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and
    Durability. An ACID transaction is a transaction intended to guarantee
    validity even in the event of an interruption. In short
    ACID transactions are a set of rules that guarantee fault tolerance in
    processing a request.

  <h4>Atomicity</h4>
  <p>
    Transactions are atomic, meaning all changes are committed or no changes are
    committed. Basically, if a transaction fails, the state changes are rolled
    back to the state before the transaction started.
  </p>
  <h4>Consistency</h4>
  <p>
    A transaction is a correct operation. This means that the transaction should
    not violate any integrity rules associated with state. The database should
    be in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
  </p>
  <h4>Isolation</h4>
  <p>
    Each transaction is isolated from other transactions. This means that one
    transaction is not visible to other transactions until it is committed. This
    prevents transactions from interfering with each other.
  </p>
  <h4>Durability</h4>
  <p>Once a transaction is committed, changes are permanent and durable.</p>
