    <p>A behavioral design pattern, the Visitor
        pattern allows you to add or define new
        functionality to an object without changing
        the object's code. The new logic resides in
        a separate object called the Visitor.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>Implications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows for adding new behaviors to an object without changing its code.</li>
        <li>Allows for gathering related behaviors and accumulating state across differing classes.</li>
        <li>Can be costly if changing class hierarchies is likely. Interface updates will have to be made for all
            visitors to match.</li>
        <li>Encapsulation can also be broken if the visitor is given access to private members of the visited class.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Use Cases</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An object structure contains many classes of objects with differing interfaces, and you want to perform
            operations on these objects that depend on their concrete classes.</li>

        <li>Many distinct and unrelated operations need to be performed on objects in an object structure, and you want
            to avoid “polluting” their classes with these operations. Visitor lets you keep related operations together
            by defining them in one class. When the object structure is shared by many applications, use Visitor to put
            operations in just those applications that need them.</li>

        <li>The classes defining the object structure rarely change, but you often want to define new operations over
            the structure. Changing the object structure classes requires redefining the interface to all visitors,
            which is potentially costly. If the object structure classes change often, then it's probably better to
            define the operations in those classes.
        </li>
    </ul>
