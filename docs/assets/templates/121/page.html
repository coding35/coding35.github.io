        A single bit register is a sequential device that stores a single bit of data. It is composed of a data flip-flop
        (DFF) and a multiplexer (Mux). The Mux is used to control the input of the DFF. When the load input is set to 1,
        the Mux will pass the input value to the DFF. When the load input is set to 0, the Mux will pass the output value
        of the DFF to itself. The output of the DFF is the output of the single bit register.
