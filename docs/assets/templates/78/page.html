        Double-Checked Locking is a software design pattern used to reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first
        testing the locking criterion (the "lock hint") without actually acquiring the lock. Only if the locking 
        criterion check indicates that locking is required does the actual locking logic proceed.

        With the singleton, this technique can be used to initialize a singleton in a thread safe way by first checking
        the instance variable is not null and then locking the class to ensure that only one thread can create the instance.
        In later versions of C# this may no longer be needed with the use of the Lazy&lt;T&gt; instancing.
