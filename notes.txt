Class Inheritance vs Interface Inheritance
It’s also important to understand the difference between class 
inheritance and interface inheritance (or subtyping). 
Class inheritance defines an object’s implementation in 
terms of another object’s implementation. 
In short, it’s a mechanism for code and representation sharing. 
In contrast, interface inheritance (or subtyping) describes when an object can be used in place of another.
